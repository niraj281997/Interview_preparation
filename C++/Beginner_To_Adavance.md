# ðŸ“˜ C++ Learning Roadmap

This repository contains a **weekly learning plan for C++**, designed for both **beginners** and **advanced learners**.  
The plan removes overly basic topics and focuses on practical programming, OOP, STL, and modern C++ features.  

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Track (7 Weeks)
Focus: Problem-solving + OOP fundamentals.

### Week 1: Core Syntax & Control Flow
- If/else, switch  
- Loops: for, while, do-while  
- Practice small logic-based problems  

### Week 2: Functions & Modular Code
- Functions with parameters & return values  
- Scope & lifetime of variables  
- Inline functions  

### Week 3: Arrays & Strings
- 1D & 2D arrays  
- `std::string` vs char arrays  
- Basic string functions  

### Week 4: Pointers & Memory Management
- Pointers with arrays and functions  
- Dynamic allocation (`new`, `delete`)  
- Intro to references  

### Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Basics
- Classes & objects  
- Constructors & destructors  
- Member functions  

### Week 6: OOP â€“ Advanced Basics
- Inheritance & polymorphism  
- Encapsulation & abstraction  
- Virtual functions  

### Week 7: Standard Template Library (STL)
- Vectors, sets, maps  
- Iterators  
- Basic algorithms (sort, find, reverse)  

---

## ðŸ”µ Advanced Track (7 Weeks)
Focus: Modern C++ and high-level concepts.

### Week 1: Advanced Memory Management
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`)  
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)  
- Avoiding memory leaks  

### Week 2: Templates & Generic Programming
- Function templates  
- Class templates  
- Template specialization & SFINAE basics  

### Week 3: Advanced OOP
- Operator overloading  
- Abstract classes & interfaces  
- Multiple inheritance (and diamond problem)  

### Week 4: Exception Handling & Error Safety
- Try/catch/throw  
- Custom exceptions  
- Best practices for error handling  

### Week 5: Modern C++ Features (C++11/14/17/20)
- Lambda functions  
- `auto`, `decltype`, `constexpr`  
- Range-based loops & structured bindings  

### Week 6: Multithreading & Concurrency
- Threads (`std::thread`)  
- Mutex, locks, condition variables  
- Atomics & thread safety  

### Week 7: Advanced STL & Design Patterns
- Priority queues, heaps, unordered maps  
- Common design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer)  
- Writing clean, performant C++ code

## âœ… How to Use
- Follow the **beginner track** if youâ€™re new to C++ or programming.  
- Jump directly into the **advanced track** if you already know the basics.  
- Each week, practice by solving problems or building small projects to apply what youâ€™ve learned.
